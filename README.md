Basically, I can play this game by controling my hand's movements. 

- Left hand go left -> the character moves to the left ‚¨ÖÔ∏è
- right hand go right -> the character moves to the right ‚û°Ô∏è
- left&right hand go up -> the character jumps ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
- left&right hand go down -> the character crouchs ‚¨áÔ∏è

## Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è
### Dependencies
1. python == 3.10.0 (64-bit)
2. opencv-python == 4.8.0.76
3. PyAutoGUI == 0.9.54
4. mediapipe == 0.10.5

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: These were the dependencies on which this project was done. It may or may not work as efficiently/correctly on other versions

## Quick Start

1. Create a Virtual Environment:
```
python -m venv your_virtual_env_name  # For Windows
# or
python3 -m venv your_virtual_env_name  # For Linux
```

2. Activate the Virtual Environment:
```
source your_virtual_env_name/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
# or
.\your_virtual_env_name\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
```

3. Install Dependencies from requirements.txt:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Now, select the virtualenv kernel and Run the all the shell line by line which are present in [Playing-Subway-Surfere-Game-using-pose-detection.ipynb](https://github.com/Datastar07/Subway-suffer-Game-using-AI/blob/main/Playing%20Subway%20Surfers%20Game%20using%20Pose%20Detection.ipynb)

5. In that, you need to start the game using this link [Game-link](https://poki.com/en/g/subway-surfers) and than you need to run second last shell in [Playing-Subway-Surfere-Game-using-pose-detection.ipynb](https://github.com/Datastar07/Subway-suffer-Game-using-AI/blob/main/Playing%20Subway%20Surfers%20Game%20using%20Pose%20Detection.ipynb)


- follow the Demo video and play this game.

## Note:üìå
All the game is how works this all details are avilable in this python code [Playing-Subway-Surfere-Game-using-pose-detection.ipynb](https://github.com/Datastar07/Subway-suffer-Game-using-AI/blob/main/Playing%20Subway%20Surfers%20Game%20using%20Pose%20Detection.ipynb)

## Customization:‚öôÔ∏è
